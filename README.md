# MFE with NX - Overview

This project adopts the cutting-edge technology of Webpack's Module Federation with NX, consolidating into a seamless workflow of micro-frontends architecture. It consists of a shell app and two remote apps, allowing isolated development, separate deployment, and shared state across the apps.
Micro-frontends Architecture
Instead of building a single monolithic application, we deconstruct it into multiple smaller parts, known as micro-frontends. It allows independent teams to work on isolated sections, promoting scalability and ease of development.

## Shell App

The shell (or host) app is the core application from which all other remote applications are loaded. It acts as a container for the micro-frontends.

`npx nx serve shell` to start the shell app.

`npx nx serve shell --devRemotes=brand-settings` to dev one app

## Remote Apps

There are two remote apps in this project, which are separately loadable and deployable yet share the same lifecycle and state as the shell app. They are micro-frontends loaded by the shell app.
